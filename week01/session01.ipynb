    "A function:\n",
    "- *MUST* perform some action.\n",
    "- *CAN* have one or more inputs, that it will use while performing the action.\n",
    "- *CAN* have one or more outputs, that is the result of performing the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look more closely at some functions we've already covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `print`\n",
    "    - Action: Prints some data on the screen.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The data to be printed\n",

    "2. `input`\n",
    "    - Action: Prints a prompt to the screen, and accepts some textual input from the user.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The prompt text (string)\n",
    "    - Outputs: The user's input (string)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `<List>.insert`\n",
    "    - Action: Inserts an element into a list at the given index position.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The index position and the element to insert\n",
    "    - Outputs: None\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the inputs are called **parameters** or **arguments**. The outputs are called **return values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions accept multiple data types for their arguments, while others don't. Always check the documentation for reference.\n",

    "```\n",
    "    def <FUNCTION NAME>(<PARAM1>, <PARAM2>...):\n",
