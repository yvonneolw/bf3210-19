    "\n",
    "In short, we can do two things with functions: **call** them, and **define** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a function is often referred to as **calling** the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function:\n",
    "- *MUST* perform some action.\n",
    "- *CAN* have one or more inputs, that it will use while performing the action.\n",
    "- *CAN* have one or more outputs, that is the result of performing the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look more closely at some functions we've already covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `print`\n",
    "    - Action: Prints some data on the screen.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The data to be printed\n",
    "    - Outputs: None\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `input`\n",
    "    - Action: Prints a prompt to the screen, and accepts some textual input from the user.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The prompt text (string)\n",
    "    - Outputs: The user's input (string)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `<List>.insert`\n",
    "    - Action: Inserts an element into a list at the given index position.\n",
    "    - Inputs: The index position and the element to insert\n",
    "    - Outputs: None\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the inputs are called **parameters** or **arguments**. The outputs are called **return values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions accept multiple data types for their arguments, while others don't. Always check the documentation for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the functions that do return a value, we can capture their output by assigning it to a variable. That is what we've been doing with our `input` function.\n",
    "\n",

    "user_name = input(\"What is your name?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write our own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    def <FUNCTION NAME>(<PARAM1>, <PARAM2>...):\n",
    "        <DO SOMETHING>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return <RETURN VALUE>\n",

    "**Even if you define a function, nothing will happen unless you call it!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Does the order of the parameters matter?\n",
    "- Does it matter what you name the function? What are the rules and conventions for naming functions?\n",
