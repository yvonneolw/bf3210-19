# BF3210 (AY2018-19 Semester 2)

This repository contains course materials for the course _BF3210: Issues in Global Financial Markets_ (AY2018-19 Semester 2). 

## Overview

In BF3210: Issues in Global Financial Markets, students work in teams throughout the semester to create financial web applications. The only requirement for these applications is that they leverage technology to make financial data more accessible to those in the financial industry; further details are left up to individual teams. Instructors are available to advise on individual projects during class hours. Teams present their completed projects to a panel of judges from industry leaders. Projects are evaluated on their usability, relevance, and technical aptitude.

This course assumes no prior knowledge of Python, but strong quantitative skills are required.

## Course Structure

There are 10 sessions of 4 hours each. The first two lessons are used to introduce the fundamentals programming principles, as well as the syntax of the Python language. These will consist almost entirely of lectures and in-class programming exercises.

For each of the remaining sessions, the instructors will lecture on a selected topic for the first 60–90 minutes. The rest of the session time will be for teams to work on their projects.

Programming exercises may be assigned both during and/or after each session, especially during the first few weeks that cover the fundamentals of Python programming. For exercises assigned after class, the solutions will be covered in the following session.

The weekly lecture topics are designed to be relevant to the current stage of the team projects. The topics listed in the syllabus are tentative; if multiple project teams express demand for a topic to be covered, it may be worked into the schedule. However, such topic requests should be made in advance, to allow for time to prepare content.

## Contact

Students should aim to resolve questions during class hours. However, the instructors may be reached by email about any project-related inquiries throughout the week.

## Schedule
